      <h2>Let's Get in Touch</h2>
      <p class="intro-text">
        Whether you're interested in working together on a project, have questions about my "experience", or just want to hire me, I'd love to hear from you. I'm always open to connecting with others who share a passion for learning, growing, and creating. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Iâ€™m currently based in Illinois and studying full stack development. The best way to contact me is through a smoke signal, but only on the third tuesday of every month. I also check my MCC email regularly. If you are attempting to reach out via smoke signal, please specifically use red flares so that I am aware that the smoke is for me, and is not in fact just a house-fire. I can also be contacted via Myspace, Vine, or unhinged, nonsensical rants written on the walls of a public bathroom in permanent marker.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thanks for visiting my site! If you have any feedback or suggestions for improvement, I'm all ears! You can find my contact details below, along with a few images that represent how I work, communicate, and stay motivated.
      </p>
